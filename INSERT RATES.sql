So today I decided lets try something different.... Something I havent had in a while.. somewhere New to me

The Resturant was clean... Bright and inviting

Ordering was simple...I asked a few questions to make a finial decision

Ordered the Gyro platter and Gyro French fry platter

Really good choices
Recommend both items.... Especially the fry platter for a drunken night','298_2BlF7sqUMnEo8W7XLQ','UiZSd7pWKJnIkBA-1-cCgg')

I ordered a steak & cheese with extra cheese.  There was barely any steak or cheese.  Campus places like this should be greasy, cheesy and big helpings...

Will definitely not be back.','298_2BlF7sqUMnEo8W7XLQ','ruh9CH6SKxO2ptJ_yIAAMA')

Came here because a local spot was closed.
I came in ordered my food. Then a lined formed after I had paid. Multiple orders after mine went out before. It had been 30mins for my order. 
When I asked how much longer, the cashiers response/attitude was not what I expected. Automatically trying to tell me to calm down when all I
asked was how much longer.
On top of that. She isnt wearing a face mask properly.
She touched multiple things, food and her face without sanitizing or cleaning her hands. Im sorry but covid aside I think its proper food handling.
Im sure the cook is the owner and he came out to refund me with gloves on from the kitchen who knows if he changed them after touching the register 
and before going back to the food.','298_2BlF7sqUMnEo8W7XLQ','o3h4H3PWNsy9_sNSVL-pKA','298_2BlF7sqUMnEo8W7XLQ','o3h4H3PWNsy9_sNSVL-pKA')

Their gyros, cheesesteaks, and subs are the perfect cheat foods. Theyre most known for their fries, which are served with a Chick-Fil-A-like sauce and feta cheese.  

Make sure to look out for their deals--they usually have lunch deals Monday-Thursday where you can get a gyro and fries for about $6.

Warning: stay away from their pizza. I dont think anyone considers Marathon a pizza place but I made the mistake of ordering their pepperoni pizza once and all it 
was was a pita break with a few slices on melted cheese and four pepperonis on top....','298_2BlF7sqUMnEo8W7XLQ','4W2y0bD9qApsJpaHYNcLZQ')

fries with sauce. For 3.75 you get a plate full of fries and their famous marathon sauce. For a poor person like me, this is the perfect comfort food after failing

due to Corona virus concerns, another well-loved College Park institution is still open for business: Marathon Deli.

I like the new digs on Route 1, although the smaller, "hole in the wall" place they moved from had its quaintness, thats for sure. But demand for Marathons tasty 
eats necessitated a bigger, easier-to-get-to location. The new spot fits the bill nicely.

The reason why Im a fan is because the cook staff takes their time to make things hot and right; the counter employees are efficient and make sure the to-go 
packaging is well done.

My favorite is the chicken souvlaki platter; three kabobs come with a mountain of fries, pita bread, Greek salad, along with dipping sauces. The spanakopita is a 
winner; has an unmistakable homemade taste and crispy crust. The baklava is pedestrian. Portions are generous. Prices are reasonable.

The large mural on one of the walls featuring a terrapin (Marylands mascot) is a fun original.

This is one of College Parks best places to get some good grub. And student customers are noticeably respectful while here.

saying Saburo Ramen letting me know I was in the right place

Ive had better ramen but it did hit the spot. I like how they were playing Gimli studio movies on the TVs even thought it was set up like a sports bar',

Ambiance - its giving fishing boat/ fish market appearance. The wood fixtures and netting add to the ambiance. The restaurant is split in two. The ramen restaurant and the Korean bbq. We went to the ramen side.

Menu - the menu is primarily written in Korean, but there are some English headings to go along with it. The listings arent all being described, but Im assuming the most popular menu items are what have the longest
descriptions. The selection is slim for seafood eaters (pescatarians beware), but theres a plethora of chicken and pork options. Theres a nice drink menu selection. 
You can choose from bottled beverages, wines and beers.

Now to the good part...the FOOD!

Appetizer- I ordered the fried vegetable Gyoza. VERY good. It was nice and crispy, golden and hot. The little dipping sauce they give you was tasty.

Ramen- I ordered the Jjampong ramen which is seafood (octopus, squid, mussels and shrimp). It had a lot of tasty vegetables in it, which is new for me since Ive had 
only Japanese ramen (believe me there is a difference I see now). The broth was delicious and spicy just like I like. The noodles, very good. Im comparing to another
ramen place I went to, and theyre pretty close in comparison.

Overall, I enjoyed it and would definitely come back again. Quick meal, nice environment and authenticity, this is your place.','qJJIvbYPOBIuyaTXdh1aOA','Qr6XUvW9WKuJgEi4jGPTBg')

Service wasnt the best but the portion and food make up for it. Word of the wise...you pay at the front. My server watched me sit there until I saw a couple
go up and realized you had to pay up front. I had t black ramen with tofu instead of chashu.','qJJIvbYPOBIuyaTXdh1aOA','60GaICcbzHVQUFLYiRykRg')

with the black garlic oil!!. The ramen was good, but the garlic oil was a little burnt. I could tell that if the oil was cooked just a few seconds less the ramen 
would have been perfect. But even with the slightly off flavor the ramen itself was still really good. The noodles were cooked nicely and the broth very creamy 
and savory. I also had an order of.Gyoza and Kimchi fried rice, bother were ok. Not really note worthy.  I ordered my husband the spicy tonkotsu to go and it was
super delicious.
So I do hope to return and try it out again, love revisiting ramen spots to try the different ramen they offer. But Im super intrigued by the Korean BBq as well.',

- Chicken ramen - there was RAW ONION in the soup!! It was about half of a diced raw white onion with nothing done to take away the burning acidity. Ive never seen this in ramen before! Maybe they confused scallion for onion? My boyfriend spent most of the meal trying to fish it out. The broth tasted very gamey (like old chicken entrails) and the meat was a somewhat weird processed meat. Yuck.

- Spicy pork bento - nothing about this makes it a bento - it was just a main with a blah lettuce only salad and generic dressing. I was hoping for pork belly but it was small, thin shriveled up chunks of pork. Did have an ok B+ spicy gochujang sauce, but the majority of the dish was undercooked large cut vegetables (like 4 inch onion and pepper slices). Surprisingly inauthentic.

- Thai tea bubble tea - this was so bad I wanted to gag when I tried it. It was not thai tea flavored at all, but some sort of artificial syrup (no condensed milk, no orange color). Instead of tapioca, the bubbles were I very artificial peach or "green tea" flavored popping bubbles that made the whole drink taste like cleaning fluid. What a disappointment.

Overall, a meal so bad it was actually a really funny experience. Im very confused what was happening with the kitchen this day. I very rarely give 1 star reviews. Dont go here!',
